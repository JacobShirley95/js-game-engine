Update pools:
-BasicPool >
    -processes updates from each stream

-NetworkedUpdateQueue (Pool) >
    -an extension of the basic pool, with networked clients being added

-LockstepUpdatePool
    -uses a "frame" parameter to get all updates with the same frame value, from multiple streams
    -it processes this collection of updates with the "update processors"
    -makes sure that this game is a defined amount of time/ticks behind the host client
    -if this is the host client, updates are processed as and when they come in
    -when an update is processed by the host, a new update is created
    -this update tells other clients that this client is being processed


Update processors stack:
-ServerHandler >
    -handles client initialisation, data just from the central server
    -should be uniform across games, i.e., no two games p2p games should need different server handlers

-WorldInitialiser >
    -handles initialisation of the world object
    -sets initial positions of the game objects
    -resets the world when a new client connects. this is so that the game is synchronised across clients.

-WorldPickingHandler >
    -creates picking handles for each connection ("stream")
    -handles mouse movement
